# RealAd Website & Infrastructure Monorepo

This is the official open-source monorepo for the **RealAd Software Development and Technical Partner Company** website.

## üì¶ Structure

This monorepo is managed with [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io) workspaces and contains two main packages:

- `nextjs/` ‚Äì The corporate website built with **Next.js**
- `pulumi/` ‚Äì Infrastructure as code using **Pulumi** and **AWS**

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a **real-world development case study** demonstrating:

- Modern **infrastructure-as-code (IaC)** using Pulumi
- Best practices for building and deploying a **Next.js corporate site**
- Integration with **AWS Amplify** for CI/CD
- Clean and maintainable **monorepo** setup using `pnpm`

It also acts as a companion resource for Medium articles published by the RealAd team, detailing the architecture, process, and lessons learned.
